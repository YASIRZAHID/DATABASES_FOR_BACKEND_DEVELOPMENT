# DATABASES_FOR_BACKEND_DEVELOPMENT
NOTES FOR FUTURE REFRENCING

# TYPES OF DATABASES
RELATIONAL DATABASES
OOP DATABASES >> DATA:OBJECTS >>
GRAPH DATABASES >> DATA:NODES >> RELATION:EDGES
DOCUMENT DATABASES >> DATA:JSON >> ORGNIZED IN TABLES

# HOSTING
DEDICATED MACHINE
CLOUD

CLOUD IS PREFFERED BECAUSE IT ALLOWS TO
STORE MANAGE RETRIEVE DATA
ACCESS DATA VIA INTERNET
LOW COST OPTION

# HOW TO CREATE RELATION DATA:
EACH INSTANCE SHOULD HAVE UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS i.e: PRIMARY KEYS

# TYPES OF CHARTS USED TO PRESENT DATA
BAR CHARTS
BUBBLE CHARTS
LINE CHARTS
PIE CHARTS
DUAL AXIS CHARTS
GANTT CHARTS
HEAT MAPS
SCATTER PLOT CHARTS

GRAPH IS CHOOSEN ON BASES OF TAGET AUDIENCE, INFORMATION, GOAL.

# ALTERNATIVE TYPES OF DATABASES
RELATIONAL DATABASES MOSTLY STORE STRUCTURAL DATA SO THERE IS LIMITATION TO TYPE OF DATA THEY CAN STORE.SO FOR NON STRUCTURA DATABASES NOSQL DATABASES ARE USED BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE FLEXIBLE AND SCALABLE DATA STRUCTURE.(CURRENTLY USED BY AI SOCIAL MEDIA IOT DEVICES)
## TYPES OF NOSQL DATABASES
DOCUMENT DATABASES
KEY-VALUE DATABASES
GRAPH DATABASES

## DIG DATA
COMPLEX DATA THAT INCREASES IN VOLUME WITH TIME
includes variety of data types
more powerful than traditional data
provides unique insight

e.g used by manufacturing sector, retail, telecommunication

## cloud hosting
requires no infrastructure, maintenance, storage costs
many providers
more affordble

## BUSSINESS INTELLIGENCE
analyze the data to perform informed decissions
